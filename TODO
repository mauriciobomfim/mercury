 * Change the directory layout of the repository.

 * Write docs, more samples and a test suite.

 * Implement before/after hooks (using coroutines).

 * Implement halt and the not_found and error handlers.

 * Make streamable responses more user-friendly.

 * The rest that is currently missing... :-)
